These formulas use 3 custom formulas: NUMBER_TO_COL1, NUMBER_TO_COL2, and IMPRINTS_ADDRESS:

- NUMBER_TO_COL1: converts an integer (meant to be a column index) into a letter. This requires an external cell to have an integer in it.
- NUMBER_TO_COL2: converts an integer (meant to be a column index) into a letter. Uses the integer typed into the formula.
- IMPRINTS_ADDRESS: Concatenates a string that's meant to be a page range that's compatible with either of the top 2 formulas.
They all have their respective pages.
